      "Ingredients\n",
      "- 1 cup (225 g) unsalted butter, softened\n",
      "- 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar\n",
      "- 4 large eggs, room temperature\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n",
      "- 2 cups (240 g) all-purpose flour\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons baking powder\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n",
      "- 1/2 cup (120 ml) milk, room temperature\n",
      "\n",
      "Steps\n",
      "1) Preheat and prep\n",
      "- Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).\n",
      "- Grease an 8-inch round cake pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Dry ingredients\n",
      "- In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Cream butter and sugar\n",
      "- In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy (about 3–4 minutes).\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Add eggs and vanilla\n",
      "- Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.\n",
      "- Beat in vanilla extract.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Combine wet and dry\n",
      "- Add the dry ingredients in three additions, alternating with milk (start and end with dry ingredients). Mix just until combined. Do not overmix.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Bake\n",
      "- Pour batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.\n",
      "- Bake 25–30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few crumbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Cool and frost\n",
      "- Let the cake cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then turn out onto a rack to cool completely.\n",
      "- If frosting, spread with your favorite buttercream or frosting once completely cooled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips\n",
      "- Room temperature ingredients mix more smoothly.\n",
      "- Don’t overbeat after adding the dry ingredients.\n",
      "- For chocolate variation, replace 1/4–1/2 cup of flour with cocoa powder, or fold in melted chocolate.\n",
      "- To stack layers, cool completely, then level the top before frosting.\n",
