He had brought the bottle of wine he had bought, and he had a bouquet of flowers in his hand. Sarah was surprised to see him, but she was also happy to be back home.\n\n\"Hi, Jack,\" she said, smiling.\n\n\"Hi, Sarah,\" Jack replied, handing her the flowers and the wine.\n\nThey spent the next few hours catching up and reminiscing about their time apart. Jack was thrilled to be with Sarah again, and he couldn't help but feel like they were meant to be together.\n\nAs the night wore on, Jack and Sarah grew more and more comfortable with each other. They talked about their hopes and dreams, their fears and insecurities. Jack found himself opening up to Sarah"}
