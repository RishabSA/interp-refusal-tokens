      "- 250 g powdered sugar\n",
      "- 1–2 tbsp milk (adjust for consistency)\n",
      "- 1 tsp vanilla extract\n",
      "\n",
      "Equipment\n",
      "- Two 9-inch round cake pans, greased and lined with parchment\n",
      "- Mixing bowls\n",
      "- Electric mixer or whisk\n",
      "- Spatula\n",
      "- Toothpick or cake tester\n",
      "- Cooling rack\n",
      "\n",
      "Steps\n",
      "1) Preheat and prepare. Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F). Grease the pans and line the bottoms with parchment circles.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Whisk dry ingredients. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Cream butter and sugar. In a large bowl, beat the softened butter and sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3–4 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Add eggs and vanilla. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then mix in the vanilla extract.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Combine wet and dry. With the mixer on low, add the dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with milk (dry, milk, dry, milk, dry). Mix just until combined. Do not overmix.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Divide batter. Evenly distribute the batter between the two prepared pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Bake. Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few crumbs. If using a convection oven, start checking around 20–25 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) Cool. Let the cakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "9) Frost (optional). Beat the butter and powdered sugar together, then add milk and vanilla until you reach a spreadable consistency. Frost between the layers, then cover the top and sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips\n",
      "- Room temperature ingredients blend more smoothly; if your butter is cold, the batter may be lumpy.\n",
      "- Don’t overmix after adding the flour; this keeps the cake tender.\n",
      "- If you don’t have parchment, you can grease and lightly flour the pans, but parchment helps remove the cakes cleanly.\n",
      "- For a chocolate version, replace 2–3 tablespoons of flour with 2–3 tablespoons of cocoa powder.\n",
