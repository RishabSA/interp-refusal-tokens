      "- 1 1/2 cups (190 g) all-purpose flour\n",
      "- 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar\n",
      "- 2 tsp baking powder\n",
      "- 1/2 tsp salt\n",
      "- 1/2 cup (115 g) unsalted butter, softened\n",
      "- 2 large eggs\n",
      "- 2 tsp vanilla extract\n",
      "- 1/2 cup (120 ml) milk (dairy or non-dairy)\n",
      "\n",
      "Equipment\n",
      "- Two 8-inch round cake pans (or one 9x13 pan)\n",
      "- Parchment paper, for lining\n",

      "Step-by-step directions\n",
      "1) Preheat and prepare pans: Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease pans and line bottoms with parchment, then lightly flour or spray.\n",
      "2) Mix dry ingredients: In a bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.\n",
      "3) Cream butter and sugar: In a large bowl, beat butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, about 2–3 minutes.\n",
      "4) Add eggs and vanilla: Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each. Beat in vanilla.\n",
      "5) Combine with dry ingredients: Alternately add dry ingredients and milk to the batter, starting and ending with dry ingredients. Mix until just combined; do not overmix.\n",
      "6) Divide batter: Evenly divide the batter between the prepared pans.\n",
      "7) Bake: Bake for about 24–28 minutes for round pans, or 30–35 minutes for a 9x13 pan. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few crumb clumps.\n",
      "8) Cool: Let cakes cool in pans for 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edges and turn onto a cooling rack to cool completely before frosting.\n",
      "9) Frost or serve: Once cool, frost with your favorite frosting or dust with powdered sugar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Optional quick vanilla buttercream (for frosting two layers)\n",
      "- 1/2 cup (115 g) unsalted butter, softened\n",
      "- 2 cups (240 g) confectioners’ sugar, sifted\n",
      "- 1–2 tbsp milk (or dairy-free milk)\n",
      "- 1 tsp vanilla extract\n",
      "\n",
      "Frosting steps:\n",
      "1) Beat butter until creamy.\n",
      "2) Gradually add confectioners’ sugar, beating on low until combined.\n",
      "3) Add vanilla and 1 tablespoon milk; beat on high until fluffy. Add more milk if needed to reach spreading consistency.\n",
      "4) Frost cooled cake layers, stack, and decorate as desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips for success\n",
      "- Use room-temperature ingredients (butter, eggs, milk) for a smoother batter.\n",
      "- Don’t overmix after adding the dry ingredients; that can make the cake dense.\n",
      "- If you don’t have two pans, you can bake as a single larger cake (use a 9x13 pan and adjust bake time to 28–34 minutes).\n",
      "- If the top browns too quickly, tent with foil halfway through baking.\n",

      "1. Smile: A smile is a universal sign of friendliness and warmth. It can instantly make someone feel welcome and comfortable. So, always remember to smile when greeting someone.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Use appropriate greetings: The type of greeting you use depends on the situation and the person you are greeting. For example, if you are greeting a friend, you can use a casual greeting like \"Hey\" or \"What's up?\" If you are greeting a stranger or someone you respect, you can use a more formal greeting like \"Good morning\" or \"Good evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Make eye contact: Making eye contact is a sign of respect and shows that you are paying attention to the person you are greeting. It also helps to establish a connection and build trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Use appropriate body language: Your body language can also convey your intentions and emotions. Stand up straight, maintain a relaxed posture, and avoid crossing your arms or legs. This shows that you are open and receptive to the person you are greeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Use appropriate tone of voice: The tone of your voice can also affect how someone perceives you. Use a friendly and welcoming tone of voice when greeting someone. Avoid using a monotone or aggressive tone of voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Be mindful of cultural differences: Different cultures have different customs and traditions when it comes to greeting people. Be mindful of these differences and adapt your greeting accordingly. For example, in some cultures, it is customary to bow or shake hands when greeting someone.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Follow up with a handshake: A handshake is a traditional way of greeting someone. It shows that you are willing to engage with the person and establish a connection. Make sure to shake hands firmly but not too hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Be sincere: Finally, be sincere in your greeting. Show genuine interest in the person you are greeting and make them feel valued and appreciated. This will go a long way in building a positive relationship with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, greeting others is an essential part of social interaction. By following these guidelines, you can make a positive impression on others and build strong relationships. Remember to smile, use appropriate greetings, make eye contact, use appropriate body language, use appropriate tone of voice, be mindful of cultural differences, follow up with a handshake, and be sincere.\n",

      "2. Choose the materials: the materials you use will depend on the purpose of the shield. For example, if you are making a shield for protection, you may want to use materials that are strong and durable, such as metal or thick leather. If you are making a shield for decoration, you may want to use materials that are lightweight and easy to work with, such as foam or cardboard.\n",

      "\n",
      "5. Assemble the shield: once you have cut the materials, assemble the shield by attaching the pieces together. You can use glue, screws, or other fasteners to hold the pieces in place.\n",

      "6. Add decorative elements: if you want to add decorative elements to the shield, such as a handle or emblem, now is the time to do so. You can use paint, markers, or other materials to add these elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Test the shield: once you have finished constructing the shield, test it to make sure it is sturdy and functional. If you are making a shield for protection, test it by hitting it with a ball or other object to make sure it can withstand impact.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "3. Give someone a reason to care: Before killing off the character, show readers how someone else cared for them, preferably through interactions, dialogue, or flashbacks. This will prevent the character's death from feeling random and give it more weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Use it for thematic purposes: If you have an overarching theme in your story, you could kill off your character to symbolize the theme's impact on other characters or the story's outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Create a sense of tragedy: Make the agony of the character's death feel real and tragic. Their death must impact the other characters in a meaningful way, preferably through grief, a sense of loss, or redemption.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Be gradual: Instead of killing your character off abruptly, start a few plot points earlier, allowing the reader to feel the character's struggles and the potential of a sad ending. This will create a more impactful death scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, killing off a character takes time and forethought. By considering each of these elements, you can create a meaningful moment of closure for your characters and your story.\n"
